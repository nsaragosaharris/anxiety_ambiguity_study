# anxiety_ambiguity_study
This repository contains the data and code (task and analysis) for a study examining how responses to ambiguity correspond to anxiety during the transition to adulthood.

*Task.*
The stimuli for the fMRI task and post-scan behavioral task (code is located in scripts/task) are from the Racially Diverse Affective Expression (RADIATE) face stimulus set, an open access dataset. The stimuli are not included here but are included in the supplemental materials in the original study from the creators of the stimulus set (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178117321893). The superimposed image that we created is in the scripts/tasks/mri_task folder.

*Representational similarity analysis.*
The representational similarity analysis scripts (in scripts/rsa_scripts) are written in Python 3 and use nilearn (https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html), a Python library.

1. If you are getting errors about libraries not loading, you probably have not installed the necessary requirements (included in scripts/rsa_scripts/requirements.txt). To install the necessary requirements, type this: pip install -r requirements.txt.
2. Note: If the virtual environment doesnâ€™t seem to be working, this is how you delete it and create a new one.
rm -rf venv
module load python/3.7.0
python3.7 -m venv venv/
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
